| Xena compiles easy-to-use data files derived from public resources like TCGA or GDC. These tab-delimited files, such as Pan-cancer gene expression data matrix, can be easily imported into R or python.

We download genomics source data from public repositories and wrangle them into a generic tabular or matrix format files.  For example, we download more than a thousand individual TCGA Breast cancer gene expression data files, compile them into a single tab-delimited file of gene expression data matrix. These easy-to-use pre-compiled data files can be easily imported into R, python, or a Jupyter notebook to be used in further bioinformatics analysis.
