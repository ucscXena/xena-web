| Discover new trends and validate your findings with 1500+ datasets and 50+ cancer types.

We provide interactive online visualization of seminal cancer genomics datasets, including data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Genomic Data Commons (GDC). We also visualize the UCSC RNA-seq compendium which contains data from TCGA tumor samples, TCGA normal samples, and GTEx normal samples. 

Xena supports virtually any functional genomics data, including SNVs, INDELs, large structural variants, copy number variation, gene-, transcript-, exon-, miRNA-, LncRNA-, protein-expressions, DNA methylation, ATAC-seq signals, phenotypic/clinical annotations, and higher-level derived genomic parameters.
