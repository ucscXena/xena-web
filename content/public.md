| Discover new trends and validate your findings with 1500+ datasets and 50+ cancer types.

We provide interactive online visualization of seminal cancer genomics datasets, including data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and UCSC RNA-seq compendium. 

Xena supports virtually any functional genomics data, including SNVs, INDELs, large structural variants, copy number variation, gene-, transcript-, exon-, miRNA-, LncRNA-, protein-expressions, DNA methylation, ATAC-seq signals, phenotypic annotations, and higher-level derived genomic parameters.
