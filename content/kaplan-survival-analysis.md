| Our survival analyses have p-values, custom time cutoffs, and multiple survival endpoints.

Whether you're looking at DNA, RNA, methylation or protein, we can help you determine if a gene affects survival. Stratify your samples by any genomic or phenotypic data (e.g. expression, copy number, subtype, age, etc) and determine if there is a statistically significant survival difference.

##Example: KM analysis for TCGA lower grade glioma histological subtypes
![example](/images/kaplan-survival.png)

Black boxes highlight, from top to bottom, a button to generate a PDF, the statistical analysis results, a dropdown menu to select different survival endpoints such as overall or recurrence-free survival, and a textbox to enter a custom survival time cutoff (currently set to 3,650 days, or 10 years). Patients characterized as having the astrocytoma histological subtype have significantly worse 10-year overall survival compared to the oligodendroglioma and oligoastrocytoma subtypes (p < 0.05).
