| Use Xena to compare TCGA tumor samples to GTEx normal samples to see if your gene or transcript is up- or down-regulated in one or more cancer types.

Xena offers two sources of normal tissue: TCGA's solid tisue normal samples from individuals with cancer, and GTEX normal tissue from individuals who do not have cancer.
