| Use Xena to compare TCGA tumor samples to GTEx normal samples to see if your gene or transcript is up- or down-regulated in one or more cancer types.

Xena offers two sources of normal tissue: TCGA's solid tisue normal samples GTEX which has expression data from normal tissue of individuals who do not have cancer.  

## Example: Comparing MYC gene expression between GTEx normal colon tissue to TCGA colon adenocarcinom

These two views show that MYC gene expression is highest in tumor samples.
